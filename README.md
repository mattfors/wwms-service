  <em>The</em> <strong>Wacky Warehouse Management System</strong> <em>is a custom WMS created purely for experimentation. Any resemblance to actual warehouse management systems, either living or dead, is purely coincidental. This system is the product of wild experimentation and should not be used for real-world logistics (unless youâ€™re feeling adventurous).</em>
